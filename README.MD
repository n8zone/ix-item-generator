# ITEM CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

Contained in the dist/templates folder are three example templates. Clothes, food, and plain.

To create a new item run the .exe within the dist folder and enter the name of the template you would like to use.

You will be presented with different fields depending on the item.

Items marked with the '#' symbol require numeric values. Entering non-numeric values may cause errors when attempting to load the item on your server.


# TEMPLATE CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

To create a template simply create a new text file in the dist/templates folder.

Name the file whatever you please and then open it in your preferred text editor.

To add a field simply add a new line following the format 'ITEM.variable =' without the 's.

To declare a numeric field, use the format 'ITEM.variable #=

From there you can add any functions you'd like to the item.
